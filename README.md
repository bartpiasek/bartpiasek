### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught python coder. Currently I am focusing on the Django framework and REST API. I also have a basic understanding of JavaScript and React. I am looking for my first job as a Junior Python Developer.

I am currently working on one large project MVP for my friend [Foodhunterki](https://www.instagram.com/foodhunterki/) :

- [x] fhstoreApp - simple e-commerce with user authentication and cookies
- [ ] fhapipageApp - RapidAPI integration - :hourglass:in progress 90%
- [ ] fhblog - simple blog page - :hourglass:in progress 80%
- [ ] global user authentication system for all apps
- [ ] newsletter with CallToAction page
- [ ] crm system connected to the e-commerce store (fhstore)
