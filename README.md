### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**bartpiasek/bartpiasek** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a self-taught python coder. Currently I am focusing on the Django framework and REST API. I also have a basic understanding of JavaScript and React. I am looking for my first job as a Junior Python Developer. I spend about 6-7 hours a day developing my programming skills, I am a time management freak:wink:

I am currently working on one large project:
:heavy_multiplication_x:simple e-commerce, with user authorization and cookies
:heavy_multiplication_x:home page with blog
:heavy_multiplication_x:newsletter
I also plan to connect the spoonacular API
