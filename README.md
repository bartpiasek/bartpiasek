### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught python coder. Currently I am focusing on the Django framework and REST API. I also have a basic understanding of JavaScript and React. I am looking for my first job as a Junior Python Developer. I spend about 6-7 hours a day developing my programming skills:clock8:, I love it:heart:

I am currently working on one large project for my friend [Foodhunterki](https://www.instagram.com/foodhunterki/) :

- [x] simple e-commerce with user authorization and cookies
- [ ] rapidAPI integration - :hourglass:in progress 60%
- [ ] home page with blog - :hourglass:in progress 80%
- [ ] newsletter
